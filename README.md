The game will feature platforming challenges, puzzles, and most importantly action. Players will solve puzzles, do quests, and discover new items throughout their adventures. They will have to decide which items to keep and which items to leave behind on their journey. Items can have a very wide range of uses. From increasing jump height and speed to unlocking new abilities like dashing, rolling, or wall-jumping. Items are commonly weapons themselves. (guns, swords, fireballs, anything you can imagine)
